## About the project:

This time I'm making a library. This will be a single page, where the user can make a list with books, indicating name, author, number of pages and if it was read or not.

This is just another practice. This time it's about object constructors, first with the "old" way (`function` constructors and `prototype`s), then the modern way (`class`, `constructor`, etc), the "syntactical sugar" way, as introduced in ECMAScript 6 in 2015.

I took a peek to the next lessons because I wanted to use classes, but the code needs to be written the "old" way, then be refactored with `class`, so I'm going to start with function constructors.

This is how it should start:

```javascript
let myLibrary = [];

function Book() {
  // the constructor...
}

function addBookToLibrary() {
  // do stuff here
}
```

## what I plan to do:

I was thinking on making something more visual, like a bookshelf with physical books representing each one, but I may get carried away from the objective, so I'll start with something basic, then go nuts with the design. As a little roadmap, here is what I need:

### the page:
- a header
- an "add book" button
- an image for the empty state and some sugestion
- the main content with `display: grid` to show the books list in cards, with:
- - the book title
- - the author
- - number of pages
- - a disabled checked/unchecked checkbox showing the "read" status
- - an "edit" button
- an edit/add book modal with:
- - an input text for book title
- - an input text for author
- - an input number for pages
- - a checkbox for "read"
- - a "save"/"add" button (context sensitive)
- - a "cancel"/"delete" button (context sensitive)

### the code:
- an array to store all the books as objects
- a function constructor that will have:
- - an array for the book's title
- - an array for the book's author name
- - a num primitive for number of pages
- - a boolean for "read" status
- a prototype for a shared function to toggle the "read" status
- as sugested by the course, the index may be stored in the DOM as a data-attribute

I think this is enough to start. As always, I'll update this README.md with my progress.

## update 1
I started with the project, nothing special, just a `<header>` and a `<main>`. I've been browsing for color palletes, but I think I need more than those two things before deciding for this, so I made everything grayscale for now.

I downloaded the Coffee Tin font from [here](https://www.1001freefonts.com/coffee-tin.font) to use in the project. This font looks amazing, but I'm not sure how I should handle it, having a very black top half and mostly transparent bottom half. For now I'm using it in the title.

After this, I started writing the `CSS`, preparing the terrain for the cards. I went for the `grid` display, with `auto-fit` for columns, so it can adjust itself dynamically depending on the viewport width.

Then I started with the card design. It looked so bland, so I changed it's borders and added a linear-gradient to make it like a book. It was going to have a disabled checkbox to indicate the read status, but I went for something a little different: a ribbon with a "read" message wrapped in the corner of the book (the card).

![](READMEmd/progress01.png)

The ribbon is a `::before` and `::after`. The text is isolated in one of those so I can rotate it 45Â° without rotating the full object. The other one is the ribbon itself, it's shape was made with `clip-path`, then moved to the bottom left of the card. A `box-shadow` has been applied with `inset` to give it a 3D feeling, like going around the book.

For now those cards are placeholders. `JavaScript` has only been used to clone the card so I can see how it behaves with thy dynamic `grid`. Then I added the "read" class to some of the cards to check how the ribbon looks.

The card got a little edit:

![](READMEmd/progress02.gif)

First the `:hover` had a transition, but felt weird having a button, so I change it to a glow effect. I'm still not sure if I'm going to keep it, everything in the page now looks... blurry.

I also spent some time drawing a new icon for the edit button. I think now I get how InkScape works. I was expecting to draw with vectors freely, merging nodes and especting to still be a single object (like I did in the old Macromedia Flash 5 in my teen years). So I drew the pencil with individual lines, then re-drew each part as an individual object.

### next steps
I want to play a little more with `CSS`, maybe add something else in the header (I'm even thinking on making it into a footer), try some palettes and fonts, then I should start working with the code.

### edit
I forgot to mention that I'm working with the [meyerweb's CSS reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) to normalize properties between browsers, also to not have to remove `padding` and `marging` on almost everything. It feels like I have to do some extra work with it, like adding again font size, weight and other properties to `<h1>`. Anyways, I just wanted to experience working with something like this.

## update 2
I've been making adjusts in the `CSS` here and there, trying to remove the blurriness. The cards don't have a `:hover` effect anymore, it's shadow are les diffuse, the header got it's `filter: drop-shadow()` replaced by `box-shadow` with `inset` property to not lose the non-flat feeling.

After this, I went for the search bar. It will be compressed when unfocused. Once the user focuses it, or if it still have some text on it, it will expand. The background color and magnifier glass icon will be lighter.

### next steps
I still don't know about the pallete, it will be kept as grayscale for now. I should finally focus in the `JavaScript` code.

## update 2
Today I finished with the styling. I made a lot of minor changes to existing elements, except for the color palette.

Then I noticed I forgot to add a button to create cards, so I used the empty space at the right of the header. Added a little plus icon at the left of it's text, to make it more noticeable. I may change it's color to green, feels appropiate.

After finishing with the fun part, I started with `JavaScript`, the even more fun part. I made an array to store the books as objects and filled it with placeholders.

```javascript
let myLibrary = [
  {title: "book 1", author: "author 1", pages: 100, read: false},
  {title: "book 2", author: "author 2", pages: 200, read: true},
  {title: "book 3", author: "author 3", pages: 300, read: false},
  {title: "book 4", author: "author 4", pages: 400, read: false},
  {title: "book 5", author: "author 5", pages: 500, read: false}
];
```

Then I wrote a function to show each book as a card in the page. This is the code:

```javascript
function placeBooks() {
  main.innerHTML = "";

  myLibrary.forEach((book, i) => {
    const card = document.createElement("div");
    card.classList.add("card");
    
    if(book.read) card.classList.add("read");
    
    card.setAttribute("data-index", i);

    const title = document.createElement("p");
    title.classList.add("title");
    title.innerText = book.title;
    card.appendChild(title);
    
    const author = document.createElement("p");
    author.classList.add("author");
    author.innerText = `by ${book.author}`;
    card.appendChild(author);

    const pages = document.createElement("p");
    pages.classList.add("pages");
    pages.innerText = `${book.pages} pages`;
    card.appendChild(pages);
    const edit = document.createElement("button");
    edit.classList.add("edit");
    const image = document.createElement("img");
    image.src = "./media/icons/edit.png";
    edit.appendChild(image);
    card.appendChild(edit);

    main.appendChild(card);
  });
};
```

It's not intuitive at all, but this is the way I learned to do it. I may change it for an easier to read `.innerHTML` in the future if it is possible.

### next steps

I've been looking for info about modals (I wrongly called them prompts in the past) and it's really easy to use and tweak, so I'm going to make one for the book creation. On my personal projects I made modals in a "hacky way", this time I'm doing it right. I'm going to use all the knowledge I got from one of the previous practices, [forms](https://github.com/HectorVilas/odin-form), to make it look and feel good.

Once I have a functional modal, I should keep working with the code. I have to make a `constructor` for books and let the modal set it's data.
